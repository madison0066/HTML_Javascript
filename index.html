    <p style="color:darkgreen"> Hello, my name is Madison Pierce. Currently I am 18 years old, but I will be 19 on October 22. <b>Halloween is by far my favorite holiday</b>, and my favorite color is green. I am from Somerset, MA and I am super excited to start my college career at New England Institute of Technology. One thing about me is that I love animals. I have two dogs: a great dane named Bruschi and a dachshund named Nellie. The newest addition is my baby bunny named Daisy. All of my pets have <i>quite the personality</i> and I love being around them. In high school I was pretty involved with music. I play trumpet, baritone, and euphonium, and was in many groups like marching band, jazz band, show choir pit band, etc. A little bit more about me is that I love to read, play video games, and having breakfast for dinner. Overall, I would say that I am neither outgoing or quiet, but somewhere in the middle.   </p>
    <p style="color:darkgreen">I came to New England Tech because <strong>I love how interactive the program is.</strong> The fact that the program is so hands on makes, in my opinion, learning so <em>much</em> more fun and easier at the same time. I also like how the school is set up into quarters. I am not one for having too much of a break from school, because I always love learning and having something to do. I can not sit around all day. I am a person that has to be moving or else I get really antsy. Although this whole online thing is going to be tough, I am still excited to get involved in the program and meet new people. </p>
